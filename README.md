# Informatica-Developer
If you're looking for the person who working on Informatica and data stage ETL tools , Yes you're at the right place to get the work done at the best. I have been involving in informatica &amp; Data stage projects for over 8 years in health care domain and able to design and deliver the major projects in time.   In this tenure , I have experienced all things about informatica on 6 major projects as a developer and production support roles which involves multiple sources or targets like Oracle,MS SQL server, DB2, XML, Cobol ,webservices,Tibco etc.   I have done many automations using Unix shell scripts which integrates with informatica to reduce the manual intervention at the best.   I have delivered few ETL migration projects from Data stage to informatica and vice versa based on the bussiness requirements.
